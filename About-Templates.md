## Meaning of parameters used in the template.json file

Let's take an example of sample1 from the [samples](https://github.com/Udayraj123/OMRChecker/tree/master/samples). 

You may use below commands from project root to load the sample template.
```bash
# Note: you may remove previous inputs (if any) with `mv inputs/* ~/.trash` 
cp -r ./samples/sample1 inputs/
python3 main.py --setLayout
```
Which shows the template overlay like below -
<p align="center">
  <img alt="Initial Layout" width="400" src="./images/sample1_template_overlay.jpg">
</p>


Let's examine the template.json used in this sample.
```js
{   
  // The dimensions to which each input image will be resized to before processing
  "Dimensions": [
    1846,
    1500
  ],
  // The dimensions of the overlay bubble area
  "BubbleDimensions": [
    40,
    40
  ],
  // Custom configuration values to use in the template's directory
  "Options": {
    "Marker": {
        // path to marker file
      "RelativePath": "omr_marker.jpg",
        // a factor by which marker shall be resized relative to input image 
      "SheetToMarkerWidthRatio": 17
    }
  },
  
// The Contatenations parameter is a way to tell OMRChecker which fields need to be joined together before outputting into the csv.
  "Concatenations": {
    // For example, the "Roll" key corresponds to a single column in the output csv, which would be generated by concatenating the fields Squad, Medium, roll0, roll1, etc. Note: all these keys need to be present in one of the QBlocks.
    "Roll": [
      "Squad",
      "Medium",
      "roll0",
      "roll1",
      "roll2",

      "roll4",
      "roll5",
      "roll6",
      "roll7",
      "roll8"
    ],
    // This is another use case of Concatenations - for two-digit integer type questions. Concatenating the two columns in the template("q5.1" and "q5.2") eases the answer checking in the csv.
    "q5": [
      "q5.1",
      "q5.2"
    ],
    // ...
  },
  // All the remaining fields(in order) whose readings shall be forwarded directly in the output csv
  "Singles": [
    "q1",
    "q2",
    "q3",
    // ...
  ],
  // Each rectangular box you see in the template overlay image is an element of QBlock 
  // QBlock is either a rectangular box, or a grid of such boxes.
