>  Co-motivation session attempt:
        Refactoring : 45 mins 
        > ONLY RELATED TO CLI 

        // HAHAHAH, said 30 mins, took more than 30 days for end to end(10 Oct) - CLI : 30 mins 
            > implement

        Local Test & fine tuning: 30 min

        Ground Rules: 
            NO OPTIMIZATION : NEED BENCHMARK FOR CURRENT CODE 
            MINIMAL SCOPE

    Refactoring the CLI way 
        > same config
        > input can be a single file or a directory (any path)!
            > src folder
            > json input for config(think CLI)
            > path as argument
        1. GET RID OF config.py
            -> defaults can stay.
            -> config.json 
                -> more separation from template.json 
        2. Casings to snake_case everywhere
            -> coz constants are better readable that way 
            -> But library calls would be camelCase!
                -> Yep, need camelCase for functions etc, only constants be snake_case

Later think 
    Where were these consumed before?
    "GAMMA_HIGH": 1.25,
    "MIN_STD": 25,

    > Further enhancements 
        > Partial overrides for localized config objects (like envStack!)
        > For template - Works but doesn't make sense because of how it is read.
        Do on-demand
            > Schema val`idation for json files - extract ajv from existing file

            # import os
            # import sys
            # sys.path.append(os.path.realpath("./src")) # Add src/ to PATH for internal use (Note: this must execute before using internal imports.)

                > it's pointless boii. You may have someone else to do it when needed. Be concise.
    // not a priority, but important - port it to react
    give little bit of styling

    side note: it's public. after prototype add IAM there
