	//> But store only those which satisfied cropping (non errs)
	//> Also blur names while at it

// Get new db, backup old one

//** So the filename is there in output sheet, not file-id!
	> Use input_paths

//** Missing file-ids : Not your fault, skip em from both X n Y

> FINE TUNING required here. see if low effort fixes solve them.

	-> They remain a challenge I'd say
	-> Lighting can be controlled, but keeping the paper flat? doubtful.
	-> They are the distinction of mobile dataset.

Why didn't you eval old db yesterday?
	> Coz the verification wasn't done on it _//
	> But now it seems the new verification is as good as old.
